                <h3>Purposes of Software QA and Testing</h3>
                <p>Quality Assurance (QA) in software testing is a systematic process to ensure that software products and services meet specified requirements and quality standards. Its main purposes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Product Quality:</strong> To ensure that the delivered software is high-quality, functional, and meets user expectations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defect Prevention:</strong> To identify and correct defects in the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to prevent them from reaching end-users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Requirements Verification:</strong> To confirm that the software meets all specified functional, performance, and design requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increase Customer Satisfaction:</strong> To deliver a reliable and robust product that enhances user experience and satisfaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Costs:</strong> To minimize the cost of fixing errors by detecting them early, as defects found in later stages are more expensive to resolve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Reliability and Efficiency:</strong> To verify that the software operates consistently and efficiently under various conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve Development Process:</strong> To provide feedback to the development team to continuously improve development processes and practices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Functional Testing</h3>
                <p>Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies each function of the software application operates in conformance with the requirement specifications. It is a black-box testing technique where the tester is concerned with the functionality of the software (what it does) rather than its internal code structure. The main objective is to test each function by comparing the result with the requirement specification.</p>
                <h4>Types of Functional Testing:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit Testing</li>
                    <li>Integration Testing</li>
                    <li>System Testing</li>
                    <li>Sanity Testing</li>
                    <li>Smoke Testing</li>
                    <li>Regression Testing</li>
                    <li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</li>
                    <li>API Testing</li>

                <h3>Non-Functional Testing</h3>
                <p>Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the 'how' aspects of a system's operation, rather than specific functional behaviors. It focuses on the quality characteristics of the software, such as performance, usability, reliability, security, and scalability. These tests ensure that the software is robust and meets user expectations in terms of its operation and quality attributes.</p>
                <h4>Types of Non-Functional Testing:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performance Testing (includes Load, Stress, Volume, Endurance, Spike Testing)</li>
                    <li>Security Testing</li>
                    <li>Usability Testing</li>
                    <li>Compatibility Testing</li>
                    <li>Reliability Testing</li>
                    <li>Scalability Testing</li>
